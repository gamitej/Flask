## What is JSON Web Token ?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.

It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.

The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.

JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesnâ€™t have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.

## Structure of JWT :-

header.payload.signature

### Header
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
