## Task - Using SQL Database

1. Create a token when user logged in and token should be valid for 2 minutes.
2. The API's request should only be accepted when the token is valid.
3. User will make request to a particular endpoint like ('/summary') then increase the token expiry time by 3 minutes.
4. For normal endpoint like ('/details) just check the token validity.

## To run the backend server

```
python3 server/server.py
